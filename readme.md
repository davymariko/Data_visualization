## Data Visualization : Real Estate data of Immoweb

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales. A complete analysis and interpretation of the dataset need to be provided.

### The Mission:
* Be able to use pandas
* Be able to use Data visualisation libraries.(Matplotlib or Seaborn)
* Be able to establish conclusions about a dataset.

### Features
### Step 1 : Data Cleaning
The dataset is cleaned as below for further analysis.

* Duplicates
* blank spaces (ex: " I love python " => "I love python")
* errors
* empty values


### Step 2 : Data Analysis

Hereby follow the main results from the preliminary data analysis:

Which variable is the target ?
How many rows and columns ?
What is the correlation between variable/target ? (Why?)
What is the correlation between the variables/variables ? (Why?)
Which variables have the greatest influence on the target ?
Which variables have the least influence on the target ?
How many qualitative and quantitative variable is there ? How would you transform these values into numerical values ?
Percentage of missing values per column ?
### Step 3 : Data Interpretation

Data interpretation questions (non-exhaustive list)(QUESTIONS TO BE REPLACED WITH ANSWERS)
Hereby follow the main results from the data interpretation:

Are there any outliers? If yes, which ones and why?
Which variables would you delete and why ?
In your opinion, which 5 variables are the most important and why?
What are the most expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
What are the most expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
What are the most expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
What are the less expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
What are the less expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
What are the less expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
Presentation (26/10/20)
Presentation is available here.

Everyone has prepared at same time in google docs presentation. It was agreed to have 1 or 2 slides per person to kept the total presentation time within 5 minutes. No code was included in the presentation.

Contributors : Emre Ozan,Didier Ukanda,Philippe Fimmers,Sravanthi Tarani

### Development
Communication and Management
Communication went mainly through live discussion on-site. Project management was mainly carried on Trello with each person adding indipendently the labels and tasks as well as involving other team members on them.

### Merging datasets from different sources
Different indipendent teams worked on a merged dataset to be used by all the team. On the first day (21/10/20) keras team splitted the sources 

### Code merging
